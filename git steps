First, create a new repository in this directory 
git init
git add .
git commit -m "adding files"

 They are the normal steps to start a git repository. Remember that git is distributed (decentralized), means you don't need to have a "central server" (or even a network connection), to use git.

Now you want to push the changes to your git repository hosted with github. To you this by telling git to add a remote location, and you do that with this command:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

git remote set-url origin https://n00bc0der89@github.com/n00bc0der89/SimpleNodeJSExpress

Once you have done that, git now knows about your remote repository. You can then tell it to push (which is "upload") your commited files:

git push -u origin master
